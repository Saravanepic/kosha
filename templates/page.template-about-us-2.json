Our story began in 1947, during the partition of India and Pakistan, when countless families were displaced, including the family of our founder. Her grandfather, Mr. Devidas Vazirani, came to India from Karachi and opened a clothing store in the heart of Bombay, aptly naming it Davysons. Specializing in trench coats, jackets, thermal wear, and various winter accessories, Davysons quickly became the go-to winter wear store.\n\nIn 1996, Mrs. Vandana Jhangiani, daughter of Mr. Alimchand and Mrs. Prem Vazirani, led the way with the renowned Prrem’s store. Her passion and warmth earned it the nickname \"\"The Friendly Store.\"\" As a third-generation entrepreneur, our founder transformed her family business, Prrem’s, into Kosha in June 2017. Incorporating feedback from loyal customers and the community, she introduced non-itchy thermals, super warm yet lightweight jackets, and more, making Kosha's offerings more relevant and appealing to modern travelers.","font_size_des":12,"font_size_des_mb":12,"line_height_des":24,"margin_bottom_des":42,"color_des":"#3c3c3c","content_width":475,"align":"center","enable_content_border":false,"content_border_color":"#232323","video_link":"","adaptive_height_video":"56","icon_style":"style_1","color_icon":"#ffffff","bg_color_icon":"#000000","button_style":"style_1","btn_text":"","link":"shopify:\/\/pages\/about-us-2","button_1_width":165,"enable_button_custom_border":false,"button_color":"#ffffff","button_border":"#232323","button_background":"#232323","button_background_gradient":"","button_color_hover":"#232323","button_border_hover":"#232323","button_background_hover":"#ffffff","button_background_gradient_hover":"","btn_2_text":"Shop Now","link_btn_2":"","button_2_width":235,"button_2_color":"#ffffff","button_2_border":"#232323","button_2_background":"#232323","button_2_background_gradient":"","button_2_color_hover":"#232323","button_2_border_hover":"#232323","button_2_background_hover":"#ffffff","button_2_background_gradient_hover":"","button_2_spacing_top":10}}},"block_order":["ea48fb40-c5bc-4536-a283-4b32a72b4649"],"settings":{"id_section":"","container":"1170","padding_full_width":0,"mg_top_desktop":0,"mg_top_tablet":0,"mg_top_mobile":0,"mg_bottom_desktop":100,"mg_bottom_tablet":20,"mg_bottom_mobile":10,"image_banner_title":"","enable_border_title":false,"color_title":"#202020","fontsize_title":24,"fontsize_title_mb":20,"margin_bottom_title":25,"image_banner_des":"","color_des":"#202020","fontsize_des":16,"title_align":"center","style_bg":"none","bg_color":"","bg_color_gradient":"","display_type":"slide","list_gap":0,"enable_arrows":false,"arrows_position":"","enable_dots":false,"enable_autoplay":false}},"1647339296880bf6ed":{"type":"image-banner","blocks":{"22b86d0a-5cd4-489f-8b7e-eeebc28d9cb9":{"type":"smallImg","settings":{"row_reverse":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Kosha_About_Us_2.png","small_img_block_style":"style_3","smallImg_justify":"space-between","enable_divider":true,"divider_bg_color":"#232323","content_spacing_right":50,"button_spacing_left":50,"button_pos_from_center":0,"content_pos_from_center":0,"divider_position_from_center":0,"small_banner_bg_color":"#fafafa","mg_bottom_icon":25,"image_behavior":"none","sub_title":"","letter_spacing_sub_title":"","font_size_sub_title":14,"font_size_sub_title_mb":14,"margin_bottom_sub_title":14,"sub_heading_font":"font_1","font_weight_sub_title":"700","sub_title_position":"sub_title_above","color_sub_title":"#232323","heading":"What We Do: Innovation x Utility","letter_spacing_heading":"","font_size_heading":24,"font_size_heading_mb":24,"margin_bottom_heading":22,"font_weight_heading":"600","color_heading":"#232323","text":"Something for Everyone\n\nAt Kosha, we understand that the love for travel knows no bounds.
