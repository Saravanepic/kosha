Our range includes lightweight women's thermals and breathable thermal wear for women, ensuring comfort across various climates.<\/p>\n\n      <p><strong>TRADITIONAL THERMAL WEAR FOR WINTER FOR LADIES REINVENTED BY KOSHA:<\/strong><\/p>\n      <p>Partner with the best thermal wear brand in India to find the answers to questions like what to wear in winter while running, skiing, and what to wear underneath a Parka Jacket. Kosha travel wear is known for its base layer thermals, which are made of Merino Wool and Bamboo Fiber as a blend. Our Women's Thermal Wear is 100% eco-friendly and skin-friendly. Thermal sets for ladies are made from a soft new age nanotech fiber, unlike old school itchy wool, and can be worn as winter innerwear in extremely cold weather. We offer both full sleeve thermal tops for women and thermal leggings for women to provide optimum warmth and comfort. These are durable, odour-free, and have advanced moisture-wicking properties!<\/p>\n\n      <p><strong>FEATURES OF MERINO WOOL THERMALS :<\/strong><\/p>\n      <p>Our collection of women’s thermal wear is suitable for a temperature range of -20°C to 15°C. The material is soft and lightweight, making it an ideal choice for lightweight women's thermals to keep you warm and fresh. Some highlighted properties include:<\/p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Softness:<\/strong> Merino wool proves to be delightfully soft due to its fineness. It ranges from 14.5 to 23.5 micrometers, while a human hair is 30 micrometers thick! It doesn’t require any softener as it is 3 times softer than natural silk. Merino wool is the most preferred itch-free fabric to stay warm in.<\/li>\n        <li><strong>Elasticity:<\/strong> Merino wool fabrics let the body move freely thanks to their molecular structure. The fiber may be safely stretched from 25 to 30% of its natural length. It will regain its original shape after stretching up to 50% of its length when wet!<\/li>\n        <li><strong>Less damp, fresh for longer:<\/strong> Merino is known for its moisture-wicking quality and can soak up to 30% of its weight before feeling wet because of the fiber scale structure. Our merino thermals wick the moisture away from the skin into the atmosphere, keeping you dry for a longer period of time.<\/li>\n        <li><strong>Odour resistant:<\/strong> The lanolin in merino wool prevents mildew and bacteria from building up on the clothing, thus odour molecules are absorbed into the merino fiber, making it odour resistant. Merino Wool fibers naturally have antibacterial, antimicrobial properties and are hypoallergenic in nature.<\/li>\n        <li>Merino is a 100% natural resource. It is also biodegradable, organic, and environmentally friendly.<\/li>\n      <\/ul>\n\n      <p><strong>WHAT MAKES OUR THERMAL WEAR SPECIAL?<\/strong><\/p>\n      <p>Kosha has now made it possible to blend merino wool fibers with bamboo fabric, made from the pulp of bamboo plants, which are the fastest-growing grass species in the world. Bamboo fiber is soft and comfortable against the skin, as it is naturally smooth and round even without any chemical treatment. It has no sharp spurs to scratch against the skin, is a highly absorbent material, has quick-drying properties, and people who are allergic to other natural fibers like wool or hemp will usually experience no allergic reactions from wearing clothes made of bamboo fibers, prompting us to blend with merino wool for best user experience!<\/p>\n\n      <p><strong>LEARN HOW TO LAYER YOURSELF IN WINTER WITH KOSHA :<\/strong><\/p>\n      <p>Kosha designs and collections keep the winter layering system and the traveller’s comfort at the heart of their products. Kit yourself from head to toe in one place and travel hassle-free. Usually, all layers purchased from any other travel wear company would amount to INR 50,000+.
