The material is soft and lightweight, making it an ideal winter T-shirt to keep men warm and odour-free. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Why <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/kosha.co\/collections\/thermal-wear-men\"><span>merino wool thermals for men<\/span><\/a><span>? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The best thermals for sub-zero temperatures are made of merino wool. Merino wool comes from merino sheep that live in the Southern Alps of New Zealand and survive extreme temperatures of 35°C in the Summer and -20°C in the Winter. As these sheep have to survive in such extreme conditions, their body coat is temperature regulating, meaning the sheep are kept cool in the Summer and warm in the Winter. Thus, merino is an active fiber that takes in factors such as the wearer's body temperature and external conditions, making it the best fit for making thermals. The few properties of  our 100% merino wool thermals, which make it the best choice for thermal wear, are listed below:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Softness: Unlike regular wool, they do not cause skin irritation. These are so fine that when in contact with the skin, they bend. They are also hypoallergenic in nature. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Odour resistant: The lanolin in merino wool prevents mildew and bacteria from building up on the clothing, thus odour molecules are absorbed into the merino fibre, making it odour resistant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Moisture absorbing properties: Our thermals wick moisture away from the skin into the atmosphere, keeping you dry for a longer period of time. It can also absorb about 35% of its own weight before feeling wet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>What makes our thermal innerwear special? - Our very own secret sauce! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While 100% merino wool thermals are just amazing(and last long too!), they can be extremely itchy at times and hardly have any aesthetic features. We, at Kosha, have now made it possible to blend merino wool fibres with bamboo, made from the pulp of bamboo plants, which are actually the fastest-growing grass species in the world. This was made possible through extensive Research and Development on the subject, and incorporating both the properties of merino wool and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/kosha.co\/collections\/thermal-wear-men\"><span>bamboo thermal wear for men<\/span><\/a><span>'s fibre in the blend. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bamboo fiber is soft and comfortable against the skin, as it is naturally smooth and round, even without any chemical treatment. It has no sharp spurs to scratch against the skin, is a highly absorbent material, has quick-drying properties, and people who are allergic to other natural fibers like wool or hemp will usually experience no allergic reactions from wearing clothing made of bamboo fibers, prompting us to blend with merino wool for best user experience! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>These thermal inner wear particularly useful for men who are running or hiking from the bottom of the mountain (with temperatures above 10°C) to the summit (with temperatures below -5°C), where they would naturally sweat a lot and pure merino wool may not always be the best fabric for absorbing the moisture, making the merino wool thermal blend the best <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/kosha.co\/collections\/thermal-wear-men\"><span>men’s thermal wear<\/span><\/a><span> for snow in India. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We offer 2 types of thermals at pocket-friendly prices:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><br><\/b><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Thermal Tops: Our winter T-shirt for men is the perfect fit for intense outdoor activities in the winter.
